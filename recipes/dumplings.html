    <h2 class="header">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the carrots and spring onions into thin slices. Shred heart salat. Store the vegetables in a cold place until serving.</li>
        <li>Stir hoisin sauce, sweet soy sauce, sesame seeds and lime juice to a Dip Sauce. Put it in the fridge until the dumplings are done.</li>
        <li>Mix pork, spring onions, chili, garlic, bamboo shoots, soy sauce and sesame oil in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Put flour and water quickly together in a food processor. 
            The mixture will look lumpy, but it will gather and feel agile if you squeeze it. Throw the mixture out on a bench, and squeeze it together to a dough.</li>
        <li>Cut 1/3 of the dough off. Wrap the rest of the dough in plastic. Put some flour on your work bench and roll the dough to aprox 2 mm thick. </li>
        <li>Use a glass or something with a diameter of 6-8 cm to make circles and punch it through the dough. </li>
        <li>Fill the dumplings with a tea spoon of the filling. Use some water along 180 degrees of the edge of the circle. Fold the dough together, make 5-6 folds in a pattern along the edge.</li>
        <li>When all the dumplings are folded you're ready to fry them.
            Put oil in a hot pan. Throw all the dumplings in there, and brown them one medium heat on one side.
            Put 1 dl of water in the pan, and put a lid on.
            Boil them until all the water has vaporized.
            Cook them for 2 more minutes.
        </li>
        <p>Throw them in your mouth hole. Enjoy.</p>
